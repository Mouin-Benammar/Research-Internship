# Research-Internship
This work is based on the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2021 [link](https://physionetchallenges.org/2021/).
The challenge aims at developing an open source algorithm that identify
heart diseases from a set of {2, 3, 4, 6, 12}-leads of electrocardiograms recordings.
This work was done in a collaboration with INSERM in which we aimed to develop an algorithm to create an accurate and automatic diagnostic system for a variety of cardiac diseases in addition to reaching a conclusions on which type of algorithm performs better and to conclude whether two ECG leads will be enough for a good classification.
