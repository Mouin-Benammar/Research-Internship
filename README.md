# Research-Internship
This work is based on the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2021 [link](https://physionetchallenges.org/2021/).
The challenge aims at developing an open source algorithm that identify
heart diseases from a set of {2, 3, 4, 6, 12}-leads of electrocardiograms recordings.
In this work,we aimed to develop an algorithm to create an accurate and automatic
diagnostic system for a variety of cardiac diseases. The goal of our project is also to
reach conclusions on which algorithm is better and what type of inputs should be
used.
